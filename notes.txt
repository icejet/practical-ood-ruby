Design classes with a single responsibility.
  - Always access data via methods (NOT INSTANCE VARIABLES)
  - If you're unsure of how to change something for the future you may not
    have enough information so just wait until you have more.
  - Classes must be easy to reuse even in unexpected ways
  - If they do too much at once they are harder to reuse
  - Rephrase methods as questions and ask them out loud
  - Describe the class in a single sentence
    - Look out for words like 'and' and 'or' they signify cohesion problems
